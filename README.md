# FCC Drum Machine Project

## Front End Development Libraries Certification

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The app plays different sounds depending on which key is pressed. You can also switch between the two drum kits by clicking on the drum banks.
